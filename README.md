# commercetools JavaScript Training Exercises

This repo contains exercises for the [commercetools JS SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs) training. 
These exercises complement the training program, and are not intended to deliver a full understanding of commercetools by themselves.

If you are interested in attending a training, please [contact us directly](https://ok.commercetools.com/training-offering)!

------

These exercises are intended to run in node.js 8 on your local machine. 

Training participants should finish following exercises:
- Configure and create client
- Get project info
- Query all product types
- Query all tax categories
- Create a product
- Query products
- Search products
- Create a customer
- Create a cart
- Query a cart by id
- Update cart
- Create an order from cart
- Delete cart

Typically, the `exercise*.js` scripts will not be modified. Tasks require implementing the modules in `handson/` until the `exercise*.js` scripts show the intended behavior.
